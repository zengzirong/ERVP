## Data Files

The large-scale data files are stored in the 'dataset' directory.

The data files from the Singapore Coca-Cola Company are stored in the 'cola_new' directory:

- File 1: Customer2ID.txt - The number of customers in data files are serial numbers generated by Coca-Cola. e.g. $502785770$. This file will map such serial numbers to the Virtual Number from $1$ to $1987$.

- File 2: ODMatrix.txt - This file is a distance matrix file. Each row contains three numbers $(a, b, c)$, where $a$ and $b$ are customers' virtual numbers and $c$ is the distance in real-life between $a$ and $b$.

Below is a simple description of the input file:
